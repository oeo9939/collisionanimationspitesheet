Comment by Markus Zeller on Franks project:

++i better than i++, ++i updates i to i = i + 1 and returns i,
i++ makes a copy of i and increments i to i = i + 1, then returns the copy.

Another trick: If you want to divide a number by two you can always multiply
by 0.5. Multiplication is faster than division CPU wise.
Example: width * 0.5 is faster than width / 2.
